# jndn-management

This project consists of tools for managing an NDN forwarding daemon (NFD). It relies on the [NDN Protocol](https://named-data.net) and its associated [client library](https://github.com/named-data/jndn). It implements the NFD management specification outlined at https://redmine.named-data.net/projects/nfd/wiki/Management. Please note that this library does not yet implement all of the commands in the management specification.

 - __Nfdc.pingLocal(Face forwarder)__: ping a local NFD with /localhost/nfd to verify if it exists.

 - __Nfdc.getFaceList(Face forwarder)__: retrieve all connected faces.

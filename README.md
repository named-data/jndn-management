# jndn-management

This project consists of tools for managing an NDN forwarding daemon (NFD). It relies on the [NDN Protocol](https://named-data.net) and its associated [client library](https://github.com/named-data/jndn). It implements the NFD management specification outlined at https://redmine.named-data.net/projects/nfd/wiki/Management. Please note that this library does not yet implement all of the commands in the management specification.

## Use

With a Face that has command signing information set, call any of the following static methods:
 - `Nfdc.pingLocal(Face forwarder)`: ping a local NFD with /localhost/nfd to verify if it exists.
 - `Nfdc.getForwarderStatus(Face forwarder)`: retrieve the forwarder status information.
 - `Nfdc.getFaceList(Face forwarder)`: retrieve all connected faces.
 - `Nfdc.getFibList(Face forwarder)`: retrieve all forwarding entries in the Forwarding Information Base (FIB).
 - `Nfdc.getRibList(Face forwarder)`: retrieve all routing entries in the Routing Information Base (RIB).
 - `Nfdc.getChannelStatusList(Face forwarder)`: Retrieve the list of channel status entries from the NFD.
 - `Nfdc.createFace(Face forwarder, String uri)`: create a new face on the NFD opened to the given URI.
 - `Nfdc.register(Face forwarder, ...)`: includes several similar methods for registering a new route on the NFD.
 - `Nfdc.unregister(Face forwarder, Name route)`: unregister a route by name.
 - `Nfdc.setStrategy(Face forwarder, Name prefix, Name strategy)`: set the forwarding strategy for the given prefix.
